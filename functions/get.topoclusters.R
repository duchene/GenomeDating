# This function takes the phylograms or alignments for a group of loci. It estimates the phylograms if needed, calculates the topological distances among trees and uses PAM and silhouette widths for the desired numbers of k to output the best clustering. The output includes two equivalent elements: one contains a list for each cluster of trees, and the other contains a list for each cluster of alignments.
